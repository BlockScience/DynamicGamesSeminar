# Design and Analysis of Dynamic Games

## Overview

### Motivation

short overview of the goals of this seminar  
and knowledge application areas (including crypto/TokenEnginering), alternatively own section  

### Prerequisites

This course assumes working knowledge of multivariate calculus, linear algebra and optimization. More advanced mathematical topics will build on these areas. Additionally, a working knowledge of algorithm game theory is assumed. Approaches presented in the course are specific to state based games with many players, many mechanisms and a statespace which includes arbitrary data structures.

Depending on what field you come from, mathematical notation varies. My course material will leverage notation similar to that of Stephen Boyd at Stanford. I recommend his lecture notes on linear systems for getting acquainted with the notation.

### Topics to be covered

The course has three major components: mathematical foundations, computational methods and applications. Mathematical foundations will focus on dynamic games as dynamical systems where the inputs are controlled by strategic agents with their own beliefs, preferences, etc. Computational methods will include a survey of techniques and associated best practices with a focus on design of and decision making in real world systems. The application component will make use of the learnings in the prior two components to explore some real world systems.

There will be no grades but attendees will participate in teams which will be expected to push their assignments and projects to a public github repo.

## Syllabus

Sessions will be 2 hours. All sessions will include some lecture component. Some will include presentations from guest lecturers and most will include time for discussions.

### Part 1: Mathematical Foundations

[future link to folder in repo]

#### Week 1
Introduction to Dynamical Systems; attention will be paid to continuous time, discrete time and event based models. For simplicity only linear models will be considered initially. A sample system for which the event time, discrete time and continuous time representations are all relevant will be considered.

#### Week 2

Extension of the mathematical notation to nonlinear dynamical systems, attenion will be shifted to inputs controlled by two players and outputs representing players goals. Dynamic strategies, optimal control and the relationship between reinforcement learning and dynamic games will be introduced.

#### Week 3

Introduce the concept of the configuration space. The dynamic games formalism is extended to include a generalized statespace which is an arbitrary data structure and variations with many players as well as multiple mechanisms for transforming the system state. Agent strategies will be framed path planning alogrithms.

#### Week 4

Introduce potential functions, their differential under admissible action sets and the notion of *better response* dynamics. Discuss how gradient descent relates to dynamic optimization and how this relates to games roles as sense-making tools through the lens of estimation theory.

### Part 2: Computational Methods

[future link to folder in repo]

#### Week 5

Scoping models for computation methods Attention will be paid to seperation of temporal and spatial scales. Discussions will include mapping actors, mechanisms, metrics (KPIs) and exogenous processes. The goal is to produce models which are useful to some decision making (design or intervention) and as simple as possible but no simpler.

#### Week 6

Review a range of methods with relative strengths and weakness as well as addressing the complementary roles of models and data. System Dynamics, Agent Based Modeling, networked models and multiscale models will be reviewed. Various modeling software will referenced by this course will primarily leverage tools in the scientific python ecosystem.

#### Week 7

Highlight the concept of observability, and apply it to introduce state estimation and system identification. Explore in more details the roles of data and models in forecasting including a variety of techniques for evaluating designs and interventions in modeled systems, including sensitivity of results to the model's assumptions.

#### Week 8

Applying computational methods for design and intervention. Computational models are tools for doing computational thought experiments; session will focus on building test grids, running many experiments, scoring metrics and the practice of translating experimental data into concrete decisions while still respecting and documenting uncertainty around the expected outcome.

### Part 3: Applications

Lecture components in part 3 will be noticibly shorter focusing on examples from active projects; guest presentations and discussions will be prioritized as teams are focusing on their projects. Reference examples and guest speakers will be announced closer to the dates of these seminars.

#### Week 10

Reference Example[tbd]  with Focus on the mathematical modeling phase. 

#### Week 11

Reference Example[tbd]  with Focus on the writing and running computational experiments phase. 

#### Week 12

### Finale: Project Showcase

Live stream event for presenting projects.

## Assignments

Assignments should be submitted via pull request to this repo. All assignments (except 0) may be done as a team, each team will have a folder in the assigments directory where they can submit markdown, python code and jupyter notebooks.

### Assignment 0

Read Section 1 (pages 3-72) *Foundations* of **Engineering a Safer World** by Nancy Leveson 

Further reading in this text is recommended but not required. The purpose of this assignment is to ensure we're thinking about the role models play in engineered systems, and how those models effects the sociotechnical systems composed of those engineered systems, humans and other exogenous factors.

Deliverable: 500 word essay describing an aspects of this reading reasonates with you, that you found suprising or identify a major point you disagree with; explain why. Alternatively, provide any thoughtful reflection on the material that you feel merits the attention of others.
